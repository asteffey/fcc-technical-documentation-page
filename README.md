## Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-technical-documentation-page.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-technical-documentation-page)

The site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-technical-documentation-page.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-technical-documentation-page?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses HTML5, CSS3, and a little JavaScript to provide an example technical documentation page.
Additionally, this project has a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis, with a Gulp file, and deployment to GitHub pages.

I decided to use [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) as I was currently researching its use for a project at work.  Due to some
domain-specific constraints, gRPC unfortunately didn't turn out to be the right solution, but I did grow quite fond 
of the protocol after learning more about it.
